## ANSWER 1 - USER INPUT: 
st.title(" TRAVEL REVIEW APP")
st.header("Share with us your experience of the latest trip")
prompt = st.text_input("Enter your feedback here please:", "My trip was")

##ANSWER 2 - Handling Negative Experiences Caused by the Airline
airlinefault = PromptTemplate.from_template("The airline was responsible for the user's negative experince and hence, the response would be that customer care will reach out to you to resolve your issue")
negative1_airline_fault = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=airlinefault)

## ANSWER 3 - Handling Negative Experiences NOT Caused by the Airline
notairlinefault = PromptTemplate.from_template("The airline was not responsible for the user's negative experince and hence, the response would be that we cannot help you as this was not the airline's fault")
negative2_airline_fault = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=airlinefault)
                                          
## ANSWER 4 - Handling Negative Experiences NOT Caused by the Airline
notairlinefault = PromptTemplate.from_template("The user had a positive experience and hence, the response would be thanking the user for their feedback and hoping that they travel with the airline again")
positive_airline_fault = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=airlinefault)
